I think I contribute as a good team player as I learned that we need to use Pygame to make the game more interactive and contribute to most of the codes to align with the professor’s instructions and ensure it works. And, I also try to invite all members to work together in the meeting.

But, when it comes to Visual Studio and Pygame, I couldn’t run them on my computer since they didn’t work so I had to pass the codes to Eaint Thet Mhue so Eaint also helped us a lot to run the code and show the process. Also, other members, Naing Lin, Ming Thet and May Shin tried to figure out the codes and gave suggestions for the game development.
